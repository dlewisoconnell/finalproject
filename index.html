            In a quickly changing world where media is consumed at a break-neck pace,
              streaming has become king. For a monthly fee you can have access to just about anything you can think of. With all of this at our fingertips our access to movies has never been more convenient. But what if convenience wasn't the top priority? Instead of tearing through content so fast, what if we went back to a time when when you could hold a video tape in your hand and gaze at the box art as it lured you in?
              <p><img src="/intro-image1.jpg" class="intro-image1">It's Friday night and you're a teenager, free from school for an entire weekend. What's the first thing you do to set yourself up for a great couple of days? I know my answer was always to rent a stack of movies with my friends. Browsing the many aisles of a rental store, looking for the perfect movie to stay up late and watch. The magic you felt when you found the perfect one. A feeling repeated every week for years. 
              <p>Watching a VHS tape takes me right back to those friday nights. The fuzz and grit presenting a familiarity of the cracks and pops of an old record of your favorite song. The warble and the static acting as a log of each pass through the vcr. 
              <p><img src="/intro-image2.jpg" class="intro-image2">And while the rest of the world moves onto new technologies, donating their tape collections to make shelf space, these treasures wind up in second hand stores everywhere. My collection is full of tapes that have been plucked from thrift stores and peddlers malls across the country, and brought to a loving home here at the Video Vault. 
              <p>These tapes have been curated to craft the ultimate recreation of the movie rental experience. Welcome to the vault, please enjoy.
